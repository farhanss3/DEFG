### **1. Intake Review Team**  
**Purpose:**  
The Intake Review Team acts as the front line for all detection requests, ensuring that only well-defined, high-priority use cases move forward in the alert development lifecycle. They manage intake, prioritization, and initial triage to streamline detection engineering efforts.  

**Key Responsibilities:**  
- **Intake Management:** Receive detection requests from internal teams (e.g., threat intelligence, SOC, IR, red teams).  
- **Prioritization & Triage:** Assess and categorize incoming requests based on business impact, threat severity, and urgency.  
- **Threat Context Application:** Work with intelligence teams to enrich requests with TTPs, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and historical attack data.  
- **Scope & Feasibility Analysis:** Ensure that detection requests have clear objectives, sufficient telemetry, and viable detection logic before proceeding.  
- **Automation & Workflow Optimization:** Leverage automation tools to streamline request tracking and initial triage efforts.  
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Serve as the primary contact for detection requests, providing status updates and gathering necessary details from requesters.  

**Success Metrics:**  
- Percentage of requests properly triaged within SLAs.  
- Reduction in false positives due to improved context application.  
- Percentage of requests rejected due to lack of feasibility or telemetry gaps.

### **2. Detection Engineering Team**  
**Purpose:**  
The Detection Engineering Team is responsible for the core development of detections, ensuring high-quality, high-fidelity alerts that accurately detect threats while minimizing false positives.  

**Key Responsibilities:**  
- **Sigma Rule Development:** Create new detections based on incoming use cases, ensuring alignment with best practices and ATT&CK coverage.  
- **SQL Query Conversion & Retro Hunting:** Convert sigma rules into SQL queries for retroactive investigations and validation.  
- **Fidelity Scoring & Testing:** Assign fidelity scores based on historical data, testing results, and feedback from SOC teams.  
- **Threat Simulation & Validation:** Utilize adversary emulation and red team feedback to test and fine-tune detection logic.  
- **Documentation & Standardization:** Maintain clear documentation for each detection, ensuring it aligns with the Cyber Detection Libraryâ€™s requirements.  
- **Collaboration with Other Teams:** Work closely with threat intelligence, SOC, and IR teams to refine detection logic based on emerging threats and real-world attack data.  

**Success Metrics:**  
- Number of detections developed and deployed per month.  
- Fidelity score improvements over time.  
- Number of detections validated against real-world attack scenarios.  
- Reduction in detection development cycle time.

### **3. Alert Update Team**  
**Purpose:**  
The Alert Update Team ensures that existing detections remain effective by refining, updating, and deprecating alerts based on performance data, feedback, and evolving threats.  

**Key Responsibilities:**  
- **Alert Tuning & Optimization:** Modify existing detections to reduce false positives and improve fidelity.  
- **Deprecation & Cleanup:** Retire outdated or redundant alerts to maintain efficiency in the detection library.  
- **Performance Monitoring & Feedback Loop:** Analyze alert performance using SOC feedback and detection metrics.  
- **Threat Adaptation:** Update detections based on new TTPs, emerging threats, and environmental changes.  
- **Detection Correlation & Enhancements:** Improve alert logic by correlating detections with additional data sources for context enrichment.  
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Work with SOC analysts and detection engineers to ensure alert updates align with operational needs.  

**Success Metrics:**  
- Reduction in false positives and false negatives.  
- Number of alerts successfully updated and optimized.  
- Mean time to update (MTTU) an alert based on feedback.  
- Number of deprecated alerts to reduce noise and redundancy.

### **Additional Considerations:**  
- **Cross-Training & Rotation:** Consider rotating team members between functions periodically to prevent burnout and improve skill diversity.  
- **SLA & Workflow Automation:** Implement automation for triage, tracking, and validation processes to ensure efficient workflows.  
- **Collaboration & Feedback Loop:** Ensure all teams have a continuous feedback mechanism with SOC, IR, and threat intelligence teams to refine detections based on real-world effectiveness.
